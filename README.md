# K-Means-CaseStudy

This project is a starting point for an exercise to speedup an Java application by applying parallel concepts.

Starting from a simple naive implementation it is step by step shown how to apply several patterns to increase reactivity and response time.

This project is part of a lesson hold on the university of applied sciences Kaiserslautern.
